                    Friday.
                    Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts are
                    exchanged
                    between loved ones, all in the name of St. Valentine.

                    But who is this mysterious saint and where did these traditions come from? Find out about the

            <p class="text-dark fw-bold mt-3 ">The history of Valentine's Day—and the story of its patron saint—is
                shrouded in
                mystery. We do know that
                February has long been celebrated as a month of romance, and that St. Valentine’s Day, as we know it
                today, contains vestiges of both Christian and ancient Roman tradition. But who was Saint Valentine, and
                how did he become associated with this ancient rite?

                The Catholic Church recognizes at least three different saints named Valentine or Valentinus, all of
                whom were martyred. One legend contends that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century
                in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and
                families, he outlawed marriage for young men. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied
                Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine’s actions were
                discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death. Still others insist that it was Saint Valentine of
                Terni, a bishop, who was the true namesake of the holiday. He, too, was beheaded by Claudius II outside
                Rome.</p>

            <p class="text-dark fw-bold mt-3">
                While some believe that Valentine’s Day is celebrated in the middle of February to commemorate the
                anniversary of Valentine’s death or burial—which probably occurred around A.D. 270—others claim that the
                Christian church may have decided to place St. Valentine’s feast day in the middle of February in an
                effort to “Christianize” the pagan celebration of Lupercalia. Celebrated at the ides of February, or
                February 15, Lupercalia was a fertility festival dedicated to Faunus, the Roman god of agriculture, as
                well as to the Roman founders Romulus and Remus.

                To begin the festival, members of the Luperci, an order of Roman priests, would gather at a sacred cave
                where the infants Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, were believed to have been cared for by a
                she-wolf or lupa. The priests would sacrifice a goat, for fertility, and a dog, for purification. They
                would then strip the goat’s hide into strips, dip them into the sacrificial blood and take to the
                streets, gently slapping both women and crop fields with the goat hide.

                Far from being fearful, Roman women welcomed the touch of the hides because it was believed to make them
                more fertile in the coming year. Later in the day, according to legend, all the young women in the city
                would place their names in a big urn. The city’s bachelors would each choose a name and become paired
                for the year with his chosen woman. These matches often ended in marriage.

            <p class="text-dark fw-bold mt-3">
                Lupercalia survived the initial rise of Christianity but was outlawed—as it was deemed “un-Christian”—at
                the end of the 5th century, when Pope Gelasius declared February 14 St. Valentine’s Day. It was not
                until much later, however, that the day became definitively associated with love.

                During the Middle Ages, it was commonly believed in France and England that February 14 was the
                beginning of birds’ mating season, which added to the idea that the middle of Valentine’s Day should be
                a day for romance. The English poet Geoffrey Chaucer was the first to record St. Valentine’s Day as a
                day of romantic celebration in his 1375 poem “Parliament of Fowls,” writing, “For this was sent on Seynt
                Valentyne’s day / Whan every foul cometh ther to choose his mate.”

                Valentine greetings were popular as far back as the Middle Ages, though written Valentine’s didn’t begin
                to appear until after 1400. The oldest known valentine still in existence today was a poem written in
                1415 by Charles, Duke of Orleans, to his wife while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London following
                his capture at the Battle of Agincourt. (The greeting is now part of the manuscript collection of the
                British Library in London, England.) Several years later, it is believed that King Henry V hired a
                writer named John Lydgate to compose a valentine note to Catherine of Valois.

                Cupid is often portrayed on Valentine’s Day cards as a naked cherub launching arrows of love at
                unsuspecting lovers. But the Roman God Cupid has his roots in Greek mythology as the Greek god of love,
                Eros. Accounts of his birth vary; some say he is the son of Nyx and Erebus; others, of Aphrodite and
                Ares; still others suggest he is the son of Iris and Zephyrus or even Aphrodite and Zeus (who would have
                been both his father and grandfather).

                According to the Greek Archaic poets, Eros was a handsome immortal played with the emotions of Gods and
                men, using golden arrows to incite love and leaden ones to sow aversion. It wasn’t until the Hellenistic
                period that he began to be portrayed as the mischievous, chubby child he’d become on Valentine’s Day
                cards.

            <p class="text-dark fw-bold mt-3">
                In addition to the United States, Valentine’s Day is celebrated in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom,
                France and Australia. In Great Britain, Valentine’s Day began to be popularly celebrated around the 17th
                century.

                By the middle of the 18th, it was common for friends and lovers of all social classes to exchange small
                tokens of affection or handwritten notes, and by 1900 printed cards began to replace written letters due
                to improvements in printing technology. Ready-made cards were an easy way for people to express their
                emotions in a time when direct expression of one’s feelings was discouraged. Cheaper postage rates also
                contributed to an increase in the popularity of sending Valentine’s Day greetings.

                Americans probably began exchanging hand-made valentines in the early 1700s. In the 1840s, Esther A.
                Howland began selling the first mass-produced valentines in America. Howland, known as the “Mother of
                the Valentine,” made elaborate creations with real lace, ribbons and colorful pictures known as “scrap.”

                Today, according to Hallmark, an estimated 145 million Valentine’s Day cards are sent each year, making
                Valentine’s Day the second largest card-sending holiday of the year (more cards are sent at Christmas).

                <p class="text-dark fw-bold text-start mt-3">India’s Taj Mahal took over a decade to build, employed
                    thousands of workers and nearly bankrupted an
                    empire—all so a man could express his love for a woman.
                    <br>
                    Mughal emperor Shah Jahan commissioned the famed landmark around 1632. It was intended as a tomb for
                    his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to the couple’s 14th child. According to
                    accounts, the Shah was so despondent after his spouse’s passing that he entered a prolonged period
                    of mourning, renouncing music and other forms of entertainment for two years.
                    <br>

                    He built the Taj Mahal—with its elaborate minarets, 250-foot-high domed mausoleum and 42-acre
                    grounds—primarily as a monument to her memory. When he died in 1666, Shah Jahan was buried alongside
                    his beloved wife in the Taj’s white marble tomb.

                    The love lives of Britain’s monarchs have long been a source of public fascination, but perhaps the
                    most romantic royal tale of all concerns King Edward VIII, who chose a woman over the throne.
                    <br>
                    Edward became king in 1936 after the death of his father, George V. His brief reign was punctuated
                    by controversy, most notably his infatuation with a socialite named Wallis Simpson. Not only was
                    Simpson an American, she was a married woman who had already once divorced. As gossips portrayed
                    Simpson as everything from a scheming seductress to a German spy, the relationship plunged the
                    monarchy into crisis.
                    <br>
                    Forced to choose between love and crown, Edward abdicated the throne in December 1936. (Some
                    scholars have speculated that Edward’s Nazi sympathies—rather than his romantic ties—were the true
                    motivation behind the political push for his abdication.) Simpson quickly divorced her husband, and
                    she and Edward married in 1937. They spent the rest of their lives in retirement in France.

                    series of love poems composed when the pair first began their courtship.

                <p class="text-dark fw-bold text-start mt-3">
                    The marriage of poets Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning is one of literature’s great
                    romances, and the couple’s love for one another often spilled over into their work.
                    <br>
                    The most famous example came in 1850 with the publication of Barrett’s book “Sonnets from the
                    Portuguese,” a series of love poems composed when the pair first began their courtship. Barrett only
                    revealed the work to her husband after hearing him rail against the thematic shortcomings of what he
                    called “personal poetry.” To counter his argument, she admitted that she had once written a series
                    of 44 sonnets about her love for him.
                    <br>
                    Struck by the beauty of the poems, Browning encouraged his wife to publish them; she finally agreed
                    but insisted that they be presented as alleged translations of Portuguese sonnets in order to hide
                    their personal nature. “Sonnets From the Portuguese” contains what many consider some of Barrett’s
                    most exquisite verses and includes the immortal line, “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.”

                    of his life.
                    <br>
                    It was DiMaggi o who secured Monroe’s release from a psychiatric ward when she suffered an emotional
                    collapse in the wake of her divorce from playwright Arthur Miller, and he was reportedly considering
                    proposing to her again before her death in 1962.
                    <br>
                    DiMaggio never remarried and refused to comment on Monroe’s death to the press. In a famous romantic
                    gesture, he sent red roses to her grave in Los Angeles three times a week for the next 20 years.
